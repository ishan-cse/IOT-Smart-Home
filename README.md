# IOT-Smart-Home
We implemented this project, Model of a Smart Home using CISCO packet tracer in Computer Networking Course. This smart home is automated. Our smart home can make life easier and secure. It also can save energy and time. The house is monitoring all the time by some automated webcam that we are added in the house. And the most important thing is the owner of the house can access the house from anywhere of the world by using his smart phone.
